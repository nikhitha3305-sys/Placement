# Exercise 1 - Design Patterns Demonstrations

This project contains simple Java demonstrations of six common software design patterns, grouped into behavioral, creational, and structural categories.

## Design Patterns Included

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Implements a one-to-many dependency so that observers get notified on state changes.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates commands as objects, allowing flexible request handling.

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has a single instance and provides a global point of access.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects, letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Converts one interface to another expected by clients, enabling compatibility between different classes.
- **Composite Pattern**: Organizes objects into tree structures where individual objects and compositions are treated uniformly.

## How to Run

- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.
- Build the project to compile all sources.
- Run the main method of any demo class to see its output and behavior.
- Example: Run `behavioral.ObserverDemo` to see Observer pattern in action.

## Notes

- The code is organized into packages according to pattern categories.
- Each demo shows a focused implementation of a particular design pattern.
- Code is commented to enhance understanding.
- Ready to be discussed during your placement interview for demonstrating design pattern knowledge.
